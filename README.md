# DRIP

</p>

Drip is a wrapper for InheritedWidget to be able to handle the state management using Streams.
This is a personal project and is under-construction.

## Features

- Divide the handlers in small `DripActions`
- Provider different widgets to react a new changes in the state
- Have the possibility to use Interceptor

## Getting started

Import this library into your project:

```yaml
drip: ^latest_version
```

## Basic Usage

```dart
DripProvider<DripCounter>(
  create: (_) => DripCounter(),
  child: DripCounterPage(),
)


class DripCounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const DripCounterPage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Dripper<DripCounter, int>(
              builder: (context, state) => Text('Counter: ${state.count}'),
            ),
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                DripProvider.of<DripCounter>(context).increment();
              },
              child: const Text('Add +'),
            ),
          ]
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}



class DripCounter extends Drip<int> {
  DripCounter() : super(0);

  void increment() {
    print('Increment');
    leak(state + 1);
  }
}


```

#### DripActions
DripActions allow us to execute code in isolation, as if it were an extension of the main Drip.

```dart
class IncrementCountAction extends DripAction<DripCounterState> {
  @override
  Stream<DripCounterState> call(DripCounterState state) async* {
    yield state.copyWith(count: state.count + 1);
  }
}
```


#### Interceptors

Interceptors allow us to change or modify state before it is processed as an Action or Event.

```dart
class MemoryInterceptor<DState> extends BaseInterceptor<DState> {
  MemoryInterceptor({
    this.historySize = 50,
  });

  /// The size of the history
  final int historySize;

  /// The history list of the Drip
  final List<DState> _history = [];

  @override
  Stream<DState> call(DripEvent event, DState state) async* {
    if (event is UndoMemory<DState> && _history.isNotEmpty) {
      yield _history.removeLast();
    } else if (event is DrainMemory<DState>) {
      _history.clear();
      yield state;
    } else {
      if (_history.length >= historySize) {
        _history.removeAt(0);
      }
      _history.add(state);
      yield state;
    }
  }
}

```
